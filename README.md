# Constrained-Classification
This repository contains code for SBFW Algorithm presented in Consistent Plugin Classifier for Complex Objectives and Constraints.

To replicate the experiments presented in the paper run

```python
python run_experiments.py
```

We cover the following loss functions:
- H-mean loss
- Q-mean loss
- G-mean Loss
- Linear 0-1 Loss

and following constraints:
- Demographic Parity(DP)
- Coverage(COV)
- Equal Oppotunity (EOpp)
- KL-divergence(KLD)
